# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
    ## Turning Data in to Visual Insights.
    ## Communicating Insights using Impactful  Dashboards to help stakeholders make decisions.


## Process
    ### Connect with data in tableau. 
    
    ### ANSWER QUESTIONS WITH DASHBOARD
    
    ### CREATE INSIGHTFULL VISUALIZATIONS

## Results(Choice Option 2)(World Death Causes)

2. Also, discuss the visualizations you created, and why. For Option 2, also identify what your data question was, and how you went through the prompts.)
    # Q1: What are the top Causes of world death? 
        A1: Cardiovascular, Neoplasms, Chronic Respiratory, Digestive & Lower respiratory diseases take lionâ€™s share of being the top causes of Death.
    # Q2: How would you describe Trend of World Death Over  2 Decades?
        A2: Increasing but it has  to be seen in the context of population growth over the two decades
    # Q3: What is the impact of SDI level over number of death? 
        A3: From just seeing the numbers most deaths are in between the high & low SDI level. But again, this must be seen in the context of number of population within each SDI level.
    # Q4: What is the impact of World Bank Income level over number of Deaths?
        A4: Interestingly like SDI numbers are more in between high- and low-income levels but still must be seen in the context of number of people in each income level.
    # Q5: Which are the top continents on the number of deaths?
        A5: Numbers are highest in Asia followed by Europe and Africa.
    # Q6: Which cause of death affects most each Continent?
        A6: Neoplasms, chronic respiratory diseases and lower respiratory infections continue to be the highest contributors of death across continents.

## Challenges 
    # The data I chose was not clean enough to directly produce visualizations and I wasted a lot of time in navigating how to clean the data. It had a lot of null, missing values. Finally, I cleaned it partially in Excel sheet.
    # I forgot to save my work in Tableau public and missed my work one time and messed up on some of them.
    



## Future Goals
    # If I had time, I would dig into the dataset more and try a better dashboard and create reference line and regression model on some of the important features.
